What does the model learns
● The skip-gram model tries to shift embeddings so the target embeddings (here for apricot) 
are closer to (have a higher dot product with) context embeddings for nearby words (here 
jam) and further from (have a lower dot product with) context embeddings for words that 
don’t occur nearby (here aardvark).
