Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsigniﬁcant improvements in computational efﬁciency through factorization tricks [18] and conditional\\ncomputation [26], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 16]. In all but a few cases [22], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for signiﬁcantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[20], ByteNet [15] and ConvS2S [8], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difﬁcult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 11]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 22, 23, 19].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [28].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the ﬁrst transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [14, 15] and [8].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 29].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1,...,x n) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1,...,z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1,...,y m) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[9], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers.

We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q,K,V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention.

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h= 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[31, 2, 8].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation ﬂow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0,xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [24]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n3.5 Positional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\n5'),\n",

That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2πto 10000 ·2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any ﬁxed offset k, PEpos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [8] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1,...,x n) to another sequence of equal length (z1,...,z n), with xi,zi ∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [11]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\nlength n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\\n[31] and byte-pair [25] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rin\\n6'),\n",

This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k<n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [ 15], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k·n·d+ n·d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side beneﬁt, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5 Training\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the signiﬁcantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [31]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [17] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ= 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate= d−0.5\\nmodel ·min(step_num−0.5,step_num·warmup_steps−1.5) (3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the ﬁrst warmup_stepstraining steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps= 4000.\\n5.4 Regularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\nResidual Dropout We apply dropout [27] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the\\nsub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the\\npositional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of\\nPdrop = 0.1.\\n7'),\n",

Traditional object detection\\nmethods are built on handcrafted features and shallow trainable\\narchitectures. Their performance easily stagnates by constructing\\ncomplex ensembles which combine multiple low-level image\\nfeatures with high-level context from object detectors and scene\\nclassiﬁers. With the rapid development in deep learning, more\\npowerful tools, which are able to learn semantic, high-level,\\ndeeper features, are introduced to address the problems existing\\nin traditional architectures. These models behave differently\\nin network architecture, training strategy and optimization\\nfunction, etc. In this paper, we provide a review on deep\\nlearning based object detection frameworks. Our review begins\\nwith a brief introduction on the history of deep learning and\\nits representative tool, namely Convolutional Neural Network\\n(CNN). Then we focus on typical generic object detection\\narchitectures along with some modiﬁcations and useful tricks\\nto improve detection performance further. As distinct speciﬁc\\ndetection tasks exhibit different characteristics, we also brieﬂy\\nsurvey several speciﬁc tasks, including salient object detection,\\nface detection and pedestrian detection. Experimental analyses\\nare also provided to compare various methods and draw some\\nmeaningful conclusions. Finally, several promising directions and\\ntasks are provided to serve as guidelines for future work in\\nboth object detection and relevant neural network based learning\\nsystems.\\nIndex Terms—deep learning, object detection, neural network\\nI. I NTRODUCTION\\nT\\nO gain a complete image understanding, we should not\\nonly concentrate on classifying different images, but\\nalso try to precisely estimate the concepts and locations of\\nobjects contained in each image. This task is referred as object\\ndetection [1][S1], which usually consists of different subtasks\\nsuch as face detection [2][S2], pedestrian detection [3][S2]\\nand skeleton detection [4][S3]. As one of the fundamental\\ncomputer vision problems, object detection is able to provide\\nvaluable information for semantic understanding of images\\nand videos, and is related to many applications, including\\nimage classiﬁcation [5], [6], human behavior analysis [7][S4],\\nface recognition [8][S5] and autonomous driving [9], [10].\\nMeanwhile, Inheriting from neural networks and related learn-\\ning systems, the progress in these ﬁelds will develop neural\\nnetwork algorithms, and will also have great impacts on object\\ndetection techniques which can be considered as learning\\nsystems.

However, due to large variations in\\nviewpoints, poses, occlusions and lighting conditions, it’s difﬁ-\\ncult to perfectly accomplish object detection with an additional\\nZhong-Qiu Zhao, Peng Zheng and Shou-Tao Xu are with the College of\\nComputer Science and Information Engineering, Hefei University of Technol-\\nogy, China.

So much attention has been attracted\\nto this ﬁeld in recent years [15]–[18].\\nThe problem deﬁnition of object detection is to determine\\nwhere objects are located in a given image (object localization)\\nand which category each object belongs to (object classiﬁca-\\ntion). So the pipeline of traditional object detection models\\ncan be mainly divided into three stages: informative region\\nselection, feature extraction and classiﬁcation.\\nInformative region selection. As different objects may appear\\nin any positions of the image and have different aspect ratios\\nor sizes, it is a natural choice to scan the whole image with a\\nmulti-scale sliding window. Although this exhaustive strategy\\ncan ﬁnd out all possible positions of the objects, its short-\\ncomings are also obvious. Due to a large number of candidate\\nwindows, it is computationally expensive and produces too\\nmany redundant windows. However, if only a ﬁxed number of\\nsliding window templates are applied, unsatisfactory regions\\nmay be produced.\\nFeature extraction. To recognize different objects, we need\\nto extract visual features which can provide a semantic and\\nrobust representation. SIFT [19], HOG [20] and Haar-like [21]\\nfeatures are the representative ones. This is due to the fact\\nthat these features can produce representations associated with\\ncomplex cells in human brain [19]. However, due to the diver-\\nsity of appearances, illumination conditions and backgrounds,\\nit’s difﬁcult to manually design a robust feature descriptor to\\nperfectly describe all kinds of objects.\\nClassiﬁcation. Besides, a classiﬁer is needed to distinguish\\na target object from all the other categories and to make the\\nrepresentations more hierarchical, semantic and informative\\nfor visual recognition. Usually, the Supported Vector Machine\\n(SVM) [22], AdaBoost [23] and Deformable Part-based Model\\n(DPM) [24] are good choices. Among these classiﬁers, the\\nDPM is a ﬂexible model by combining object parts with\\ndeformation cost to handle severe deformations. In DPM, with\\nthe aid of a graphical model, carefully designed low-level\\nfeatures and kinematically inspired part decompositions are\\ncombined. And discriminative learning of graphical models\\nallows for building high-precision part-based models for a\\nvariety of object classes.\\nBased on these discriminant local feature descriptors and\\nshallow learnable architectures, state of the art results have\\nbeen obtained on PASCAL VOC object detection competition\\n[25] and real-time embedded systems have been obtained with\\na low burden on hardware. However, small gains are obtained\\nduring 2010-2012 by only building ensemble systems and\\nemploying minor variants of successful methods [15]. This fact\\nis due to the following reasons: 1) The generation of candidate\\nbounding boxes with a sliding window strategy is redundant,\\ninefﬁcient and inaccurate. 2) The semantic gap cannot be\\narXiv:1807.05511v2  [cs.CV]  16 Apr 2019'),\n",

A B RIEF OVERVIEW OF DEEP LEARNING\\nPrior to overview on deep learning based object detection\\napproaches, we provide a review on the history of deep\\nlearning along with an introduction on the basic architecture\\nand advantages of CNN.\\nA. The History: Birth, Decline and Prosperity\\nDeep models can be referred to as neural networks with\\ndeep structures. The history of neural networks can date back\\nto 1940s [35], and the original intention was to simulate the\\nhuman brain system to solve general learning problems in a\\nprincipled way. It was popular in 1980s and 1990s with the\\nproposal of back-propagation algorithm by Hinton et al. [36].\\nHowever, due to the overﬁtting of training, lack of large scale\\ntraining data, limited computation power and insigniﬁcance\\nin performance compared with other machine learning tools,\\nneural networks fell out of fashion in early 2000s.\\nDeep learning has become popular since 2006 [37][S7] with\\na break through in speech recognition [38]. The recovery of\\ndeep learning can be attributed to the following factors.\\n•The emergence of large scale annotated training data, such\\nas ImageNet [39], to fully exhibit its very large learning\\ncapacity;\\n•Fast development of high performance parallel computing\\nsystems, such as GPU clusters;\\n•Signiﬁcant advances in the design of network structures\\nand training strategies. With unsupervised and layerwise\\npre-training guided by Auto-Encoder (AE) [40] or Re-\\nstricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) [41], a good initializa-\\ntion is provided. With dropout and data augmentation, the\\noverﬁtting problem in training has been relieved [6], [42].\\nWith batch normalization (BN), the training of very deep\\nneural networks becomes quite efﬁcient [43]. Meanwhile,\\nvarious network structures, such as AlexNet [6], Overfeat\\n[44], GoogLeNet [45], VGG [46] and ResNet [47], have\\nbeen extensively studied to improve the performance.\\nWhat prompts deep learning to have a huge impact on the\\nentire academic community? It may owe to the contribution of\\nHinton’s group, whose continuous efforts have demonstrated\\nthat deep learning would bring a revolutionary breakthrough\\non grand challenges rather than just obvious improvements on\\nsmall datasets. Their success results from training a large CNN\\non 1.2 million labeled images together with a few techniques\\n[6] (e.g., ReLU operation [48] and ‘dropout’ regularization).\\nB. Architecture and Advantages of CNN\\nCNN is the most representative model of deep learning [26].\\nA typical CNN architecture, which is referred to as VGG16,'),\n",

Each layer of CNN is known as a\\nfeature map. The feature map of the input layer is a 3D matrix\\nof pixel intensities for different color channels (e.g. RGB). The\\nfeature map of any internal layer is an induced multi-channel\\nimage, whose ‘pixel’ can be viewed as a speciﬁc feature. Every\\nneuron is connected with a small portion of adjacent neurons\\nfrom the previous layer (receptive ﬁeld). Different types of\\ntransformations [6], [49], [50] can be conducted on feature\\nmaps, such as ﬁltering and pooling. Filtering (convolution)\\noperation convolutes a ﬁlter matrix (learned weights) with\\nthe values of a receptive ﬁeld of neurons and takes a non-\\nlinear function (such as sigmoid [51], ReLU) to obtain ﬁnal\\nresponses. Pooling operation, such as max pooling, average\\npooling, L2-pooling and local contrast normalization [52],\\nsummaries the responses of a receptive ﬁeld into one value\\nto produce more robust feature descriptions.\\nWith an interleave between convolution and pooling, an\\ninitial feature hierarchy is constructed, which can be ﬁne-tuned\\nin a supervised manner by adding several fully connected (FC)\\nlayers to adapt to different visual tasks. According to the tasks\\ninvolved, the ﬁnal layer with different activation functions [6]\\nis added to get a speciﬁc conditional probability for each\\noutput neuron. And the whole network can be optimized on\\nan objective function (e.g. mean squared error or cross-entropy\\nloss) via the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method. The\\ntypical VGG16 has totally 13 convolutional (conv) layers, 3\\nfully connected layers, 3 max-pooling layers and a softmax\\nclassiﬁcation layer. The conv feature maps are produced by\\nconvoluting 3*3 ﬁlter windows, and feature map resolutions\\nare reduced with 2 stride max-pooling layers. An arbitrary test\\nimage of the same size as training samples can be processed\\nwith the trained network. Re-scaling or cropping operations\\nmay be needed if different sizes are provided [6].\\nThe advantages of CNN against traditional methods can be\\nsummarised as follows.\\n•Hierarchical feature representation, which is the multi-\\nlevel representations from pixel to high-level semantic fea-\\ntures learned by a hierarchical multi-stage structure [15],\\n[53], can be learned from data automatically and hidden\\nfactors of input data can be disentangled through multi-level\\nnonlinear mappings.\\n• Compared with traditional shallow models, a deeper\\narchitecture provides an exponentially increased expressive\\ncapability.\\n• The architecture of CNN provides an opportunity to\\njointly optimize several related tasks together (e.g. Fast R-\\nCNN combines classiﬁcation and bounding box regression\\ninto a multi-task leaning manner).\\n• Beneﬁtting from the large learning capacity of deep\\nCNNs, some classical computer vision challenges can be\\nrecast as high-dimensional data transform problems and\\nsolved from a different viewpoint.\\nDue to these advantages, CNN has been widely applied\\ninto many research ﬁelds, such as image super-resolution\\nreconstruction [54], [55], image classiﬁcation [5], [56], im-\\nage retrieval [57], [58], face recognition [8][S5], pedestrian\\ndetection [59]–[61] and video analysis [62], [63].\\nIII. G ENERIC OBJECT DETECTION\\nGeneric object detection aims at locating and classifying\\nexisting objects in any one image, and labeling them with\\nrectangular bounding boxes to show the conﬁdences of exis-\\ntence. The frameworks of generic object detection methods\\ncan mainly be categorized into two types (see Figure 2).\\nOne follows traditional object detection pipeline, generating\\nregion proposals at ﬁrst and then classifying each proposal into\\ndifferent object categories. The other regards object detection\\nas a regression or classiﬁcation problem, adopting a uniﬁed\\nframework to achieve ﬁnal results (categories and locations)\\ndirectly. The region proposal based methods mainly include\\nR-CNN [15], SPP-net [64], Fast R-CNN [16], Faster R-CNN\\n[18], R-FCN [65], FPN [66] and Mask R-CNN [67], some of\\nwhich are correlated with each other (e.g. SPP-net modiﬁes R-\\nCNN with a SPP layer). The regression /classiﬁcation based\\nmethods mainly includes MultiBox [68], AttentionNet [69],\\nG-CNN [70], YOLO [17], SSD [71], YOLOv2 [72], DSSD\\n[73] and DSOD [74]. The correlations between these two\\npipelines are bridged by the anchors introduced in Faster R-\\nCNN. Details of these methods are as follows.\\nA. Region Proposal Based Framework\\nThe region proposal based framework, a two-step process,\\nmatches the attentional mechanism of human brain to some\\nextent, which gives a coarse scan of the whole scenario ﬁrstly\\nand then focuses on regions of interest. Among the pre-related\\nworks [44], [75], [76], the most representative one is Overfeat\\n[44]. This model inserts CNN into sliding window method,\\nwhich predicts bounding boxes directly from locations of\\nthe topmost feature map after obtaining the conﬁdences of\\nunderlying object categories.\\n1) R-CNN: It is of signiﬁcance to improve the quality of\\ncandidate bounding boxes and to take a deep architecture to\\nextract high-level features. To solve these problems, R-CNN\\n[15] was proposed by Ross Girshick in 2014 and obtained a\\nmean average precision (mAP) of 53.3% with more than 30%\\nimprovement over the previous best result (DPM HSC [77]) on\\nPASCAL VOC 2012. Figure 3 shows the ﬂowchart of R-CNN,\\nwhich can be divided into three stages as follows.\\nRegion proposal generation. The R-CNN adopts selective\\nsearch [78] to generate about 2k region proposals for each\\nimage. The selective search method relies on simple bottom-up\\ngrouping and saliency cues to provide more accurate candidate\\nboxes of arbitrary sizes quickly and to reduce the searching\\nspace in object detection [24], [39].\\nCNN based deep feature extraction. In this stage, each\\nregion proposal is warped or cropped into a ﬁxed resolution\\nand the CNN module in [6] is utilized to extract a 4096-\\ndimensional feature as the ﬁnal representation. Due to large\\nlearning capacity, dominant expressive power and hierarchical\\nstructure of CNNs, a high-level, semantic and robust feature\\nrepresentation for each region proposal can be obtained.\\nClassiﬁcation and localization. With pre-trained category-\\nspeciﬁc linear SVMs for multiple classes, different region pro-\\nposals are scored on a set of positive regions and background\\n(negative) regions. The scored regions are then adjusted with'),\n",

The last decade of progress on various\\nvisual recognition tasks has been based considerably on the\\nuse of SIFT [26] and HOG [7]. But if we look at perfor-\\nmance on the canonical visual recognition task, PASCAL\\nVOC object detection [12], it is generally acknowledged\\nthat progress has been slow during 2010-2012, with small\\ngains obtained by building ensemble systems and employ-\\ning minor variants of successful methods.\\nSIFT and HOG are blockwise orientation histograms,\\na representation we could associate roughly with complex\\ncells in V1, the ﬁrst cortical area in the primate visual path-\\nway. But we also know that recognition occurs several\\nstages downstream, which suggests that there might be hier-\\narchical, multi-stage processes for computing features that\\nare even more informative for visual recognition.\\nFukushima’s “neocognitron” [16], a biologically-\\n1.

Our system (1)\\ntakes an input image, (2) extracts around 2000 bottom-up region\\nproposals, (3) computes features for each proposal using a large\\nconvolutional neural network (CNN), and then (4) classiﬁes each\\nregion using class-speciﬁc linear SVMs. R-CNN achieves a mean\\naverage precision (mAP) of 53.7% on PASCAL VOC 2010. For\\ncomparison, [32] reports 35.1% mAP using the same region pro-\\nposals, but with a spatial pyramid and bag-of-visual-words ap-\\nproach. The popular deformable part models perform at 33.4%.\\ninspired hierarchical and shift-invariant model for pattern\\nrecognition, was an early attempt at just such a process.\\nThe neocognitron, however, lacked a supervised training al-\\ngorithm. LeCun et al. [23] provided the missing algorithm\\nby showing that stochastic gradient descent, via backprop-\\nagation, can train convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a\\nclass of models that extend the neocognitron.\\nCNNs saw heavy use in the 1990s ( e.g., [24]), but then\\nfell out of fashion, particularly in computer vision, with the\\nrise of support vector machines. In 2012, Krizhevsky et al.\\n[22] rekindled interest in CNNs by showing substantially\\nhigher image classiﬁcation accuracy on the ImageNet Large\\nScale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) [9, 10].\\nTheir success resulted from training a large CNN on 1.2\\nmillion labeled images, together with a few twists on Le-\\nCun’s CNN (e.g., max(x, 0) rectifying non-linearities and\\n“dropout” regularization).\\nThe signiﬁcance of the ImageNet result was vigorously\\ndebated during the ILSVRC 2012 workshop. The central\\nissue can be distilled to the following: To what extent do\\nthe CNN classiﬁcation results on ImageNet generalize to\\nobject detection results on the PASCAL VOC Challenge?\\nWe answer this question decisively by bridging the\\nchasm between image classiﬁcation and object detection.\\nThis paper is the ﬁrst to show that a CNN can lead to dra-\\n1\\nFig. 3. The ﬂowchart of R-CNN [15], which consists of 3 stages: (1) extracts\\nbottom-up region proposals, (2) computes features for each proposal using a\\nCNN, and then (3) classiﬁes each region with class-speciﬁc linear SVMs.\\nbounding box regression and ﬁltered with a greedy non-\\nmaximum suppression (NMS) to produce ﬁnal bounding boxes\\nfor preserved object locations.\\nWhen there are scarce or insufﬁcient labeled data, pre-\\ntraining is usually conducted. Instead of unsupervised pre-\\ntraining [79], R-CNN ﬁrstly conducts supervised pre-training\\non ILSVRC, a very large auxiliary dataset, and then takes a\\ndomain-speciﬁc ﬁne-tuning. This scheme has been adopted by\\nmost of subsequent approaches [16], [18].\\nIn spite of its improvements over traditional methods and\\nsigniﬁcance in bringing CNN into practical object detection,\\nthere are still some disadvantages.\\n•Due to the existence of FC layers, the CNN requires a\\nﬁxed-size (e.g., 227×227) input image, which directly leads\\nto the re-computation of the whole CNN for each evaluated\\nregion, taking a great deal of time in the testing period.\\n•Training of R-CNN is a multi-stage pipeline. At ﬁrst,\\na convolutional network (ConvNet) on object proposals is\\nﬁne-tuned. Then the softmax classiﬁer learned by ﬁne-\\ntuning is replaced by SVMs to ﬁt in with ConvNet features.\\nFinally, bounding-box regressors are trained.\\n• Training is expensive in space and time. Features are\\nextracted from different region proposals and stored on the\\ndisk. It will take a long time to process a relatively small\\ntraining set with very deep networks, such as VGG16. At the\\nsame time, the storage memory required by these features\\nshould also be a matter of concern.\\n•Although selective search can generate region proposals\\nwith relatively high recalls, the obtained region proposals\\nare still redundant and this procedure is time-consuming\\n(around 2 seconds to extract 2k region proposals).\\nTo solve these problems, many methods have been pro-\\nposed. GOP [80] takes a much faster geodesic based segmen-\\ntation to replace traditional graph cuts. MCG [81] searches\\ndifferent scales of the image for multiple hierarchical segmen-\\ntations and combinatorially groups different regions to produce\\nproposals. Instead of extracting visually distinct segments,\\nthe edge boxes method [82] adopts the idea that objects are\\nmore likely to exist in bounding boxes with fewer contours\\nstraggling their boundaries. Also some researches tried to\\nre-rank or reﬁne pre-extracted region proposals to remove\\nunnecessary ones and obtained a limited number of valuable\\nones, such as DeepBox [83] and SharpMask [84].\\nIn addition, there are some improvements to solve the\\nproblem of inaccurate localization. Zhang et al. [85] utilized\\na bayesian optimization based search algorithm to guide\\nthe regressions of different bounding boxes sequentially, and\\ntrained class-speciﬁc CNN classiﬁers with a structured loss\\nto penalize the localization inaccuracy explicitly. Saurabh\\nGupta et al. improved object detection for RGB-D images\\nwith semantically rich image and depth features [86], and\\nlearned a new geocentric embedding for depth images to\\nencode each pixel. The combination of object detectors and\\nsuperpixel classiﬁcation framework gains a promising result\\non semantic scene segmentation task. Ouyang et al. proposed\\na deformable deep CNN (DeepID-Net) [87] which introduces\\na novel deformation constrained pooling (def-pooling) layer\\nto impose geometric penalty on the deformation of various\\nobject parts and makes an ensemble of models with different\\nsettings. Lenc et al. [88] provided an analysis on the role\\nof proposal generation in CNN-based detectors and tried to\\nreplace this stage with a constant and trivial region generation\\nscheme. The goal is achieved by biasing sampling to match\\nthe statistics of the ground truth bounding boxes with K-means\\nclustering. However, more candidate boxes are required to\\nachieve comparable results to those of R-CNN.\\n2) SPP-net: FC layers must take a ﬁxed-size input. That’s\\nwhy R-CNN chooses to warp or crop each region proposal\\ninto the same size. However, the object may exist partly in\\nthe cropped region and unwanted geometric distortion may be\\nproduced due to the warping operation. These content losses or\\ndistortions will reduce recognition accuracy, especially when\\nthe scales of objects vary.\\nTo solve this problem, He et al. took the theory of spatial\\npyramid matching (SPM) [89], [90] into consideration and\\nproposed a novel CNN architecture named SPP-net [64]. SPM\\ntakes several ﬁner to coarser scales to partition the image into\\na number of divisions and aggregates quantized local features\\ninto mid-level representations.\\nThe architecture of SPP-net for object detection can be\\nfound in Figure 4.

R-CNN ﬁrst extracts about 2,000 candi-\\ndate windows from each image via selective search\\n[20]. Then the image region in each window is warped\\nto a ﬁxed size (227 ×227). A pre-trained deep network\\nis used to extract the feature of each window. A\\nbinary SVM classiﬁer is then trained on these features\\nfor detection. R-CNN generates results of compelling\\nquality and substantially outperforms previous meth-\\nods. However, because R-CNN repeatedly applies the\\ndeep convolutional network to about 2,000 windows\\nper image, it is time-consuming. Feature extraction is\\nthe major timing bottleneck in testing.\\nOur SPP-net can also be used for object detection.\\nWe extract the feature maps from the entire image\\nonly once (possibly at multiple scales). Then we ap-\\nply the spatial pyramid pooling on each candidate\\nwindow of the feature maps to pool a ﬁxed-length\\nrepresentation of this window (see Figure 5). Because\\nthe time-consuming convolutions are only applied\\nonce, our method can run orders of magnitude faster.\\nOur method extracts window-wise features from\\nregions of the feature maps, while R-CNN extracts\\ndirectly from image regions. In previous works, the\\nDeformable Part Model (DPM) [23] extracts features\\nfrom windows in HOG [24] feature maps, and the\\nSelective Search (SS) method [20] extracts from win-\\ndows in encoded SIFT feature maps. The Overfeat\\ndetection method [5] also extracts from windows of\\ndeep convolutional feature maps, but needs to pre-\\ndeﬁne the window size. On the contrary, our method\\nenables feature extraction in arbitrary windows from\\nthe deep convolutional feature maps.\\nspatial pyramid \\npooling layer\\nfeature maps of conv5\\nconvolutional layers\\nfixed-length representation\\ninput image\\nwindow\\n…...\\nfully-connected layers (fc6, fc7)\\nFigure 5: Pooling features from arbitrary windows\\non feature maps. The feature maps are computed\\nfrom the entire image. The pooling is performed in\\ncandidate windows.\\n4.1 Detection Algorithm\\nWe use the “fast” mode of selective search [20] to\\ngenerate about 2,000 candidate windows per image.\\nThen we resize the image such that min(w,h) = s,\\nand extract the feature maps from the entire image.\\nWe use the SPP-net model of ZF-5 (single-size trained)\\nfor the time being. In each candidate window, we use\\na 4-level spatial pyramid (1 ×1, 2×2, 3×3, 6×6, totally\\n50 bins) to pool the features. This generates a 12,800-\\nd (256 ×50) representation for each window. These\\nrepresentations are provided to the fully-connected\\nlayers of the network. Then we train a binary linear\\nSVM classiﬁer for each category on these features.\\nOur implementation of the SVM training follows\\n[20], [7]. We use the ground-truth windows to gen-\\nerate the positive samples. The negative samples are\\nthose overlapping a positive window by at most 30%\\n(measured by the intersection-over-union (IoU) ratio).\\nAny negative sample is removed if it overlaps another\\nnegative sample by more than 70%. We apply the stan-\\ndard hard negative mining [23] to train the SVM. This\\nstep is iterated once. It takes less than 1 hour to train\\nSVMs for all 20 categories. In testing, the classiﬁer\\nis used to score the candidate windows. Then we use\\nnon-maximum suppression [23] (threshold of 30%) on\\nthe scored windows.\\nOur method can be improved by multi-scale feature\\nextraction. We resize the image such that min(w,h) =\\ns ∈ S = {480,576,688,864,1200}, and compute the\\nfeature maps of conv 5 for each scale. One strategy of\\ncombining the features from these scales is to pool\\nthem channel-by-channel. But we empirically ﬁnd\\nthat another strategy provides better results. For each\\ncandidate window, we choose a single scale s ∈ S\\nsuch that the scaled candidate window has a number\\nof pixels closest to 224 ×224. Then we only use the\\nfeature maps extracted from this scale to compute\\nFig. 4. The architecture of SPP-net for object detection [64].\\nSPPnet also has notable drawbacks. Like R-CNN, train-\\ning is a multi-stage pipeline that involves extracting fea-\\ntures, ﬁne-tuning a network with log loss, training SVMs,\\nand ﬁnally ﬁtting bounding-box regressors. Features are\\nalso written to disk. But unlike R-CNN, the ﬁne-tuning al-\\ngorithm proposed in [\\n11] cannot update the convolutional\\nlayers that precede the spatial pyramid pooling. Unsurpris-\\ningly, this limitation (ﬁxed convolutional layers) limits the\\naccuracy of very deep networks.\\n1.2. Contributions\\nWe propose a new training algorithm that ﬁxes the disad-\\nvantages of R-CNN and SPPnet, while improving on their\\nspeed and accuracy. We call this method Fast R-CNN be-\\ncause it’s comparatively fast to train and test. The Fast R-\\nCNN method has several advantages:\\n1. Higher detection quality (mAP) than R-CNN, SPPnet\\n2. Training is single-stage, using a multi-task loss\\n3. Training can update all network layers\\n4. No disk storage is required for feature caching\\nFast R-CNN is written in Python and C++ (Caffe\\n[\\n13]) and is available under the open-source MIT Li-\\ncense at https://github.com/rbgirshick/\\nfast-rcnn.\\n2. Fast R-CNN architecture and training\\nFig. 1 illustrates the Fast R-CNN architecture. A Fast\\nR-CNN network takes as input an entire image and a set\\nof object proposals. The network ﬁrst processes the whole\\nimage with several convolutional ( conv) and max pooling\\nlayers to produce a conv feature map. Then, for each ob-\\nject proposal a region of interest ( RoI) pooling layer ex-\\ntracts a ﬁxed-length feature vector from the feature map.\\nEach feature vector is fed into a sequence of fully connected\\n(fc) layers that ﬁnally branch into two sibling output lay-\\ners: one that produces softmax probability estimates over\\nK object classes plus a catch-all “background” class and\\nanother layer that outputs four real-valued numbers for each\\nof the K object classes. Each set of 4 values encodes reﬁned\\nbounding-box positions for one of the K classes.\\n2.1. The RoI pooling layer\\nThe RoI pooling layer uses max pooling to convert the\\nfeatures inside any valid region of interest into a small fea-\\nture map with a ﬁxed spatial extent of H × W (e.g., 7 × 7),\\nwhere H and W are layer hyper-parameters that are inde-\\npendent of any particular RoI. In this paper, an RoI is a\\nrectangular window into a conv feature map. Each RoI is\\ndeﬁned by a four-tuple (r, c, h, w ) that speciﬁes its top-left\\ncorner (r, c) and its height and width (h, w ).\\nDeep\\nConvNet\\nConv\\nfeature map\\nRoI\\nprojection\\nRoI\\npooling\\nlayer\\nFCs\\nRoI feature\\nvector\\nsoftmax\\nbbox\\nregressor\\nOutputs:\\nFC FC\\nFor each RoI\\nFigure 1. Fast R-CNN architecture. An input image and multi-\\nple regions of interest (RoIs) are input into a fully convolutional\\nnetwork. Each RoI is pooled into a ﬁxed-size feature map and\\nthen mapped to a feature vector by fully connected layers (FCs).\\nThe network has two output vectors per RoI: softmax probabilities\\nand per-class bounding-box regression offsets. The architecture is\\ntrained end-to-end with a multi-task loss.\\nRoI max pooling works by dividing the h × w RoI win-\\ndow into an H × W grid of sub-windows of approximate\\nsize h/H × w/W and then max-pooling the values in each\\nsub-window into the corresponding output grid cell. Pool-\\ning is applied independently to each feature map channel,\\nas in standard max pooling. The RoI layer is simply the\\nspecial-case of the spatial pyramid pooling layer used in\\nSPPnets [\\n11] in which there is only one pyramid level. We\\nuse the pooling sub-window calculation given in [ 11].\\n2.2. Initializing from pre-trained networks\\nWe experiment with three pre-trained ImageNet [ 4] net-\\nworks, each with ﬁve max pooling layers and between ﬁve\\nand thirteen conv layers (see Section\\n4.1 for network de-\\ntails). When a pre-trained network initializes a Fast R-CNN\\nnetwork, it undergoes three transformations.\\nFirst, the last max pooling layer is replaced by a RoI\\npooling layer that is conﬁgured by setting H and W to be\\ncompatible with the net’s ﬁrst fully connected layer ( e.g.,\\nH = W = 7 for VGG16).\\nSecond, the network’s last fully connected layer and soft-\\nmax (which were trained for 1000-way ImageNet classiﬁ-\\ncation) are replaced with the two sibling layers described\\nearlier (a fully connected layer and softmax over K + 1 cat-\\negories and category-speciﬁc bounding-box regressors).\\nThird, the network is modiﬁed to take two data inputs: a\\nlist of images and a list of RoIs in those images.\\n2.3. Fine-tuning for detection\\nTraining all network weights with back-propagation is an\\nimportant capability of Fast R-CNN. First, let’s elucidate\\nwhy SPPnet is unable to update weights below the spatial\\npyramid pooling layer.\\nThe root cause is that back-propagation through the SPP\\nlayer is highly inefﬁcient when each training sample ( i.e.\\nRoI) comes from a different image, which is exactly how\\nR-CNN and SPPnet networks are trained. The inefﬁciency\\n1441\\nFig. 5. The architecture of Fast R-CNN [16].\\nproposals of arbitrary sizes to ﬁxed-length feature vectors. The\\nfeasibility of the reusability of these feature maps is due to\\nthe fact that the feature maps not only involve the strength of\\nlocal responses, but also have relationships with their spatial\\npositions [64]. The layer after the ﬁnal conv layer is referred\\nto as spatial pyramid pooling layer (SPP layer). If the number\\nof feature maps in conv5 is 256, taking a 3-level pyramid,\\nthe ﬁnal feature vector for each region proposal obtained after\\nSPP layer has a dimension of 256 ×(12 + 22 + 42) = 5376.\\nSPP-net not only gains better results with correct estimation\\nof different region proposals in their corresponding scales, but\\nalso improves detection efﬁciency in testing period with the\\nsharing of computation cost before SPP layer among different\\nproposals.\\n3) Fast R-CNN: Although SPP-net has achieved impressive\\nimprovements in both accuracy and efﬁciency over R-CNN,\\nit still has some notable drawbacks. SPP-net takes almost\\nthe same multi-stage pipeline as R-CNN, including feature\\nextraction, network ﬁne-tuning, SVM training and bounding-\\nbox regressor ﬁtting. So an additional expense on storage space\\nis still required. Additionally, the conv layers preceding the\\nSPP layer cannot be updated with the ﬁne-tuning algorithm\\nintroduced in [64]. As a result, an accuracy drop of very deep\\nnetworks is unsurprising. To this end, Girshick [16] introduced\\na multi-task loss on classiﬁcation and bounding box regression\\nand proposed a novel CNN architecture named Fast R-CNN.\\nThe architecture of Fast R-CNN is exhibited in Figure 5.\\nSimilar to SPP-net, the whole image is processed with conv\\nlayers to produce feature maps. Then, a ﬁxed-length feature\\nvector is extracted from each region proposal with a region of\\ninterest (RoI) pooling layer. The RoI pooling layer is a special\\ncase of the SPP layer, which has only one pyramid level. Each\\nfeature vector is then fed into a sequence of FC layers before\\nﬁnally branching into two sibling output layers. One output\\nlayer is responsible for producing softmax probabilities for\\nall C+ 1categories (C object classes plus one ‘background’\\nclass) and the other output layer encodes reﬁned bounding-\\nbox positions with four real-valued numbers. All parameters\\nin these procedures (except the generation of region proposals)\\nare optimized via a multi-task loss in an end-to-end way.\\nThe multi-tasks loss L is deﬁned as below to jointly train\\nclassiﬁcation and bounding-box regression,\\nL(p,u,t u,v) =Lcls(p,u) +λ[u≥1]Lloc(tu,v) (1)\\nwhere Lcls(p,u) =−log pu calculates the log loss for ground\\ntruth class u and pu is driven from the discrete probability\\ndistribution p= (p0,··· ,pC) over the C+1 outputs from the\\nlast FC layer. Lloc(tu,v) is deﬁned over the predicted offsets\\ntu = (tu\\nx,tu\\ny,tu\\nw,tu\\nh) and ground-truth bounding-box regression\\ntargets v = (vx,vy,vw,vh), where x,y,w,h denote the two\\ncoordinates of the box center, width, and height, respectively.\\nEach tu adopts the parameter settings in [15] to specify an\\nobject proposal with a log-space height/width shift and scale-\\ninvariant translation. The Iverson bracket indicator function\\n[u≥1] is employed to omit all background RoIs. To provide\\nmore robustness against outliers and eliminate the sensitivity\\nin exploding gradients, a smooth L1 loss is adopted to ﬁt\\nbounding-box regressors as below\\nLloc(tu,v) =\\n∑\\ni∈x,y,w,h\\nsmoothL1 (tu\\ni −vi) (2)\\nwhere\\nsmoothL1 (x) =\\n{\\n0.5x2 if|x|<1\\n|x|−0.5 otherwise (3)\\nTo accelerate the pipeline of Fast R-CNN, another two tricks\\nare of necessity. On one hand, if training samples (i.e. RoIs)\\ncome from different images, back-propagation through the\\nSPP layer becomes highly inefﬁcient. Fast R-CNN samples\\nmini-batches hierarchically, namely N images sampled ran-\\ndomly at ﬁrst and then R/N RoIs sampled in each image,\\nwhere R represents the number of RoIs. Critically, computa-\\ntion and memory are shared by RoIs from the same image in\\nthe forward and backward pass. On the other hand, much time\\nis spent in computing the FC layers during the forward pass\\n[16]. The truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) [91]\\ncan be utilized to compress large FC layers and to accelerate\\nthe testing procedure.\\nIn the Fast R-CNN, regardless of region proposal genera-\\ntion, the training of all network layers can be processed in\\na single-stage with a multi-task loss.

Region proposal computation is also\\na bottleneck in improving efﬁciency. To solve this problem,\\nRen et al. introduced an additional Region Proposal Network\\n(RPN) [18], [92], which acts in a nearly cost-free way by\\nsharing full-image conv features with detection network.\\nRPN is achieved with a fully-convolutional network, which\\nhas the ability to predict object bounds and scores at each\\nposition simultaneously. Similar to [78], RPN takes an image\\nof arbitrary size to generate a set of rectangular object propos-\\nals.

Each sliding window is mapped to a lower-dimensional vector (256-d for ZF and 512-d\\nfor VGG). This vector is fed into two sibling fully-connected layers—a box-regression layer ( reg)\\nand a box-classiﬁcation layer ( cls). We use n = 3in this paper, noting that the effective receptive\\nﬁeld on the input image is large (171 and 228 pixels for ZF and VGG, respectively). This mini-\\nnetwork is illustrated at a single position in Fig. 1 (left). Note that because the mini-network operates\\nin a sliding-window fashion, the fully-connected layers are shared across all spatial locations. This\\narchitecture is naturally implemented with an n×nconv layer followed by two sibling 1 ×1 conv\\nlayers (for reg and cls, respectively). ReLUs [15] are applied to the output of the n×nconv layer.\\nTranslation-Invariant Anchors\\nAt each sliding-window location, we simultaneously predict k region proposals, so the reg layer\\nhas 4k outputs encoding the coordinates of k boxes. The cls layer outputs 2k scores that estimate\\nprobability of object / not-object for each proposal. 2 The kproposals are parameterized relative to\\nkreference boxes, called anchors. Each anchor is centered at the sliding window in question, and is\\nassociated with a scale and aspect ratio. We use 3 scales and 3 aspect ratios, yieldingk= 9anchors\\nat each sliding position. For a conv feature map of a sizeW×H(typically ∼2,400), there are WHk\\nanchors in total. An important property of our approach is that it is translation invariant, both in\\nterms of the anchors and the functions that compute proposals relative to the anchors.\\nAs a comparison, the MultiBox method [20] uses k-means to generate 800 anchors, which are not\\ntranslation invariant. If one translates an object in an image, the proposal should translate and the\\nsame function should be able to predict the proposal in either location. Moreover, because the\\nMultiBox anchors are not translation invariant, it requires a (4+1) ×800-dimensional output layer,\\nwhereas our method requires a (4+2)×9-dimensional output layer. Our proposal layers have an order\\nof magnitude fewer parameters (27 million for MultiBox using GoogLeNet [20] vs. 2.4 million for\\nRPN using VGG-16), and thus have less risk of overﬁtting on small datasets, like PASCAL VOC.\\nA Loss Function for Learning Region Proposals\\nFor training RPNs, we assign a binary class label (of being an object or not) to each anchor. We\\nassign a positive label to two kinds of anchors: (i) the anchor/anchors with the highest Intersection-\\nover-Union (IoU) overlap with a ground-truth box, or (ii) an anchor that has an IoU overlap higher\\nthan 0.7 with any ground-truth box. Note that a single ground-truth box may assign positive labels\\nto multiple anchors. We assign a negative label to a non-positive anchor if its IoU ratio is lower than\\n0.3 for all ground-truth boxes. Anchors that are neither positive nor negative do not contribute to the\\ntraining objective.\\nWith these deﬁnitions, we minimize an objective function following the multi-task loss in Fast R-\\nCNN [5]. Our loss function for an image is deﬁned as:\\nL({pi},{ti}) = 1\\nNcls\\n∑\\ni\\nLcls (pi,p∗\\ni ) +λ 1\\nNreg\\n∑\\ni\\np∗\\ni Lreg(ti,t∗\\ni ).

Lcls is a binary\\nlog loss and Lreg is a smoothed L1 loss similar to (2). These\\ntwo terms are normalized with the mini-batch size ( Ncls)\\nand the number of anchor locations ( Nreg), respectively.

Introduction\\nRecognizing objects at vastly different scales is a fun-\\ndamental challenge in computer vision. Feature pyramids\\nbuilt upon image pyramids (for short we call these featur-\\nized image pyramids) form the basis of a standard solution\\n[1] (Fig. 1(a)). These pyramids are scale-invariant in the\\nsense that an object’s scale change is offset by shifting its\\nlevel in the pyramid. Intuitively, this property enables a\\nmodel to detect objects across a large range of scales by\\nscanning the model over both positions and pyramid levels.\\nFeaturized image pyramids were heavily used in the\\nera of hand-engineered features [5, 25]. They were so\\ncritical that object detectors like DPM [7] required dense\\nscale sampling to achieve good results ( e.g., 10 scales per\\noctave). For recognition tasks, engineered features have\\n(a) Featurized image pyramid\\npredict\\npredict\\npredict\\npredict\\n(b) Single feature map\\npredict\\n(d) Feature Pyramid Network\\npredict\\npredict\\npredict\\n(c) Pyramidal feature hierarchy\\npredict\\npredict\\npredict\\nFigure 1.

Aside from being\\ncapable of representing higher-level semantics, ConvNets\\nare also more robust to variance in scale and thus facilitate\\nrecognition from features computed on a single input scale\\n[15, 11, 29] (Fig. 1(b)). But even with this robustness, pyra-\\nmids are still needed to get the most accurate results. All re-\\ncent top entries in the ImageNet [33] and COCO [21] detec-\\ntion challenges use multi-scale testing on featurized image\\npyramids (e.g., [16, 35]). The principle advantage of fea-\\nturizing each level of an image pyramid is that it produces\\na multi-scale feature representation in which all levels are\\nsemantically strong, including the high-resolution levels.\\nNevertheless, featurizing each level of an image pyra-\\nmid has obvious limitations. Inference time increases con-\\nsiderably (e.g., by four times [11]), making this approach\\nimpractical for real applications.

However, it turns out to be\\ninferior with such a naive solution [47]. This inconsistence is\\ndue to the dilemma of respecting translation variance in object\\ndetection compared with increasing translation invariance in\\nimage classiﬁcation. In other words, shifting an object inside\\nan image should be indiscriminative in image classiﬁcation\\nwhile any translation of an object in a bounding box may\\nbe meaningful in object detection. A manual insertion of\\nthe RoI pooling layer into convolutions can break down\\ntranslation invariance at the expense of additional unshared\\nregion-wise layers. So Li et al. [65] proposed a region-based\\nfully convolutional networks (R-FCN, Fig. S2).\\nDifferent from Faster R-CNN, for each category, the last\\nconv layer of R-FCN produces a total of k2 position-sensitive\\nscore maps with a ﬁxed grid of k×k ﬁrstly and a position-\\nsensitive RoI pooling layer is then appended to aggregate the\\nresponses from these score maps. Finally, in each RoI, k2\\nposition-sensitive scores are averaged to produce a C + 1-d\\nvector and softmax responses across categories are computed.\\nAnother 4k2-d conv layer is appended to obtain class-agnostic\\nbounding boxes.\\nWith R-FCN, more powerful classiﬁcation networks can be\\nadopted to accomplish object detection in a fully-convolutional\\narchitecture by sharing nearly all the layers, and state-of-the-\\nart results are obtained on both PASCAL VOC and Microsoft\\nCOCO [94] datasets at a test speed of 170ms per image.\\n6) FPN: Feature pyramids built upon image pyramids\\n(featurized image pyramids) have been widely applied in\\nmany object detection systems to improve scale invariance\\n[24], [64] (Figure 7(a)). However, training time and memory\\nconsumption increase rapidly. To this end, some techniques\\ntake only a single input scale to represent high-level semantics\\nand increase the robustness to scale changes (Figure 7(b)),\\nand image pyramids are built at test time which results in\\nan inconsistency between train/test-time inferences [16], [18].\\nThe in-network feature hierarchy in a deep ConvNet produces\\nfeature maps of different spatial resolutions while introduces\\nlarge semantic gaps caused by different depths (Figure 7(c)).\\nTo avoid using low-level features, pioneer works [71], [95]\\nusually build the pyramid starting from middle layers or\\njust sum transformed feature responses, missing the higher-'),\n",

The Mask R-CNN framework for instance segmentation [67].\\nresolution maps of the feature hierarchy.\\nDifferent from these approaches, FPN [66] holds an ar-\\nchitecture with a bottom-up pathway, a top-down pathway\\nand several lateral connections to combine low-resolution and\\nsemantically strong features with high-resolution and seman-\\ntically weak features (Figure 7(d)). The bottom-up pathway,\\nwhich is the basic forward backbone ConvNet, produces a\\nfeature hierarchy by downsampling the corresponding feature\\nmaps with a stride of 2. The layers owning the same size of\\noutput maps are grouped into the same network stage and the\\noutput of the last layer of each stage is chosen as the reference\\nset of feature maps to build the following top-down pathway.\\nTo build the top-down pathway, feature maps from higher\\nnetwork stages are upsampled at ﬁrst and then enhanced with\\nthose of the same spatial size from the bottom-up pathway\\nvia lateral connections. A 1 ×1 conv layer is appended to\\nthe upsampled map to reduce channel dimensions and the\\nmergence is achieved by element-wise addition. Finally, a3×3\\nconvolution is also appended to each merged map to reduce\\nthe aliasing effect of upsampling and the ﬁnal feature map is\\ngenerated. This process is iterated until the ﬁnest resolution\\nmap is generated.\\nAs feature pyramid can extract rich semantics from all\\nlevels and be trained end-to-end with all scales, state-of-the-\\nart representation can be obtained without sacriﬁcing speed\\nand memory. Meanwhile, FPN is independent of the backbone\\nCNN architectures and can be applied to different stages of\\nobject detection (e.g. region proposal generation) and to many\\nother computer vision tasks (e.g. instance segmentation).\\n7) Mask R-CNN: Instance segmentation [96] is a challeng-\\ning task which requires detecting all objects in an image and\\nsegmenting each instance (semantic segmentation [97]). These\\ntwo tasks are usually regarded as two independent processes.\\nAnd the multi-task scheme will create spurious edge and\\nexhibit systematic errors on overlapping instances [98]. To\\nsolve this problem, parallel to the existing branches in Faster\\nR-CNN for classiﬁcation and bounding box regression, the\\nMask R-CNN [67] adds a branch to predict segmentation\\nmasks in a pixel-to-pixel manner (Figure 8).\\nDifferent from the other two branches which are inevitably\\ncollapsed into short output vectors by FC layers, the segmen-\\ntation mask branch encodes an m×m mask to maintain the\\nexplicit object spatial layout. This kind of fully convolutional\\nrepresentation requires fewer parameters but is more accurate\\nthan that of [97]. Formally, besides the two losses in (1) for\\nclassiﬁcation and bounding box regression, an additional loss\\nfor segmentation mask branch is deﬁned to reach a multi-task\\nloss. An this loss is only associated with ground-truth class\\nand relies on the classiﬁcation branch to predict the category.\\nBecause RoI pooling, the core operation in Faster R-CNN,\\nperforms a coarse spatial quantization for feature extraction,\\nmisalignment is introduced between the RoI and the features.\\nIt affects classiﬁcation little because of its robustness to small\\ntranslations. However, it has a large negative effect on pixel-\\nto-pixel mask prediction. To solve this problem, Mask R-CNN\\nadopts a simple and quantization-free layer, namely RoIAlign,\\nto preserve the explicit per-pixel spatial correspondence faith-\\nfully. RoIAlign is achieved by replacing the harsh quantization\\nof RoI pooling with bilinear interpolation [99], computing the\\nexact values of the input features at four regularly sampled\\nlocations in each RoI bin. In spite of its simplicity, this\\nseemingly minor change improves mask accuracy greatly,\\nespecially under strict localization metrics.\\nGiven the Faster R-CNN framework, the mask branch only\\nadds a small computational burden and its cooperation with\\nother tasks provides complementary information for object\\ndetection. As a result, Mask R-CNN is simple to implement\\nwith promising instance segmentation and object detection\\nresults. In a word, Mask R-CNN is a ﬂexible and efﬁcient\\nframework for instance-level recognition, which can be easily\\ngeneralized to other tasks (e.g. human pose estimation [7][S4])\\nwith minimal modiﬁcation.\\n8) Multi-task Learning, Multi-scale Representation and\\nContextual Modelling: Although the Faster R-CNN gets\\npromising results with several hundred proposals, it still strug-\\ngles in small-size object detection and localization, mainly due\\nto the coarseness of its feature maps and limited information\\nprovided in particular candidate boxes. The phenomenon is\\nmore obvious on the Microsoft COCO dataset which consists\\nof objects at a broad range of scales, less prototypical images,\\nand requires more precise localization. To tackle these prob-\\nlems, it is of necessity to accomplish object detection with\\nmulti-task learning [100], multi-scale representation [95] and\\ncontext modelling [101] to combine complementary informa-\\ntion from multiple sources.\\nMulti-task Learning learns a useful representation for\\nmultiple correlated tasks from the same input [102], [103].\\nBrahmbhatt et al. introduced conv features trained for ob-\\nject segmentation and ‘stuff’ (amorphous categories such as\\nground and water) to guide accurate object detection of small\\nobjects (StuffNet) [100].

To address this problem,\\nShrivastava et al. proposed an effective online mining algo-\\nrithm (OHEM) [113] for automatic selection of the hard ex-\\namples, which leads to a more effective and efﬁcient training.\\nInstead of concentrating on feature extraction, Ren et al.\\nmade a detailed analysis on object classiﬁers [114], and\\nfound that it is of particular importance for object detection\\nto construct a deep and convolutional per-region classiﬁer\\ncarefully, especially for ResNets [47] and GoogLeNets [45].\\nTraditional CNN framework for object detection is not\\nskilled in handling signiﬁcant scale variation, occlusion or\\ntruncation, especially when only 2D object detection is in-\\nvolved.

As a result, the time spent in\\nhandling different components becomes the bottleneck in real-\\ntime application.\\nOne-step frameworks based on global regres-\\nsion/classiﬁcation, mapping straightly from image pixels\\nto bounding box coordinates and class probabilities, can\\nreduce time expense. We ﬁrstly reviews some pioneer CNN\\nmodels, and then focus on two signiﬁcant frameworks,\\nnamely You only look once (YOLO) [17] and Single Shot\\nMultiBox Detector (SSD) [71].\\n1) Pioneer Works: Previous to YOLO and SSD, many\\nresearchers have already tried to model object detection as\\na regression or classiﬁcation task.\\nSzegedy et al. formulated object detection task as a DNN-\\nbased regression [118], generating a binary mask for the\\ntest image and extracting detections with a simple bounding\\nbox inference. However, the model has difﬁculty in handling\\noverlapping objects, and bounding boxes generated by direct\\nupsampling is far from perfect.\\nPinheiro et al. proposed a CNN model with two branches:\\none generates class agnostic segmentation masks and the\\nother predicts the likelihood of a given patch centered on\\nan object [119]. Inference is efﬁcient since class scores and\\nsegmentation can be obtained in a single model with most of\\nthe CNN operations shared.\\nErhan et al. proposed regression based MultiBox to produce\\nscored class-agnostic region proposals [68], [120]. A uniﬁed\\nloss was introduced to bias both localization and conﬁdences\\nof multiple components to predict the coordinates of class-\\nagnostic bounding boxes. However, a large quantity of addi-\\ntional parameters are introduced to the ﬁnal layer.\\nYoo et al. adopted an iterative classiﬁcation approach to\\nhandle object detection and proposed an impressive end-to-\\nend CNN architecture named AttentionNet [69]. Starting from\\nthe top-left (TL) and bottom-right (BR) corner of an image,\\nAttentionNet points to a target object by generating quantized\\nweak directions and converges to an accurate object bound-\\nary box with an ensemble of iterative predictions. However,\\nthe model becomes quite inefﬁcient when handling multiple\\ncategories with a progressive two-step procedure.\\nNajibi et al. proposed a proposal-free iterative grid based\\nobject detector (G-CNN), which models object detection as'),\n",

Main idea of YOLO [17].\\nﬁnding a path from a ﬁxed grid to boxes tightly surrounding\\nthe objects [70]. Starting with a ﬁxed multi-scale bounding box\\ngrid, G-CNN trains a regressor to move and scale elements of\\nthe grid towards objects iteratively. However, G-CNN has a\\ndifﬁculty in dealing with small or highly overlapping objects.\\n2) YOLO: Redmon et al. [17] proposed a novel framework\\ncalled YOLO, which makes use of the whole topmost feature\\nmap to predict both conﬁdences for multiple categories and\\nbounding boxes. The basic idea of YOLO is exhibited in\\nFigure 9. YOLO divides the input image into an S×S grid and\\neach grid cell is responsible for predicting the object centered\\nin that grid cell. Each grid cell predicts B bounding boxes\\nand their corresponding conﬁdence scores. Formally, conﬁ-\\ndence scores are deﬁned as Pr(Object) ∗IOUtruth\\npred , which\\nindicates how likely there exist objects ( Pr(Object) ≥0) and\\nshows conﬁdences of its prediction ( IOUtruth\\npred ). At the same\\ntime, regardless of the number of boxes, C conditional class\\nprobabilities (Pr(Classi|Object)) should also be predicted in\\neach grid cell. It should be noticed that only the contribution\\nfrom the grid cell containing an object is calculated.\\nAt test time, class-speciﬁc conﬁdence scores for each box\\nare achieved by multiplying the individual box conﬁdence\\npredictions with the conditional class probabilities as follows.\\nPr(Object) ∗IOUtruth\\npred ∗Pr(Classi|Object)\\n= Pr(Classi) ∗IOUtruth\\npred\\n(5)\\nwhere the existing probability of class-speciﬁc objects in the\\nbox and the ﬁtness between the predicted box and the object\\nare both taken into consideration.\\nDuring training, the following loss function is optimized,\\nλcoord\\nS2\\n∑\\ni=0\\nB∑\\nj=0\\n1 obj\\nij\\n[\\n(xi −ˆxi)2 + (yi −ˆyi)2]\\n+λcoord\\nS2\\n∑\\ni=0\\nB∑\\nj=0\\n1 obj\\nij\\n[(√wi −\\n√\\nˆwi)2 + (\\n√\\nhi −\\n√\\nˆhi\\n)2]\\n+\\nS2\\n∑\\ni=0\\nB∑\\nj=0\\n1 obj\\nij\\n(\\nCi −ˆCi\\n)2\\n+λnoobj\\nS2\\n∑\\ni=0\\nB∑\\nj=0\\n1 noobj\\nij\\n(\\nCi −ˆCi\\n)2\\n+\\nS2\\n∑\\ni=0\\n1 obj\\ni\\n∑\\nc∈classes\\n(pi(c) −ˆpi(c))2\\n(6)\\nIn a certain cell i, (xi,yi) denote the center of the box relative\\nto the bounds of the grid cell,(wi,hi) are the normalized width\\nand height relative to the image size, Ci represents conﬁdence\\nscores, 1 obj\\ni indicates the existence of objects and 1 obj\\nij denotes\\nthat the prediction is conducted by the jth bounding box\\npredictor. Note that only when an object is present in that grid\\ncell, the loss function penalizes classiﬁcation errors. Similarly,\\nwhen the predictor is ‘responsible’ for the ground truth box\\n(i.e. the highest IoU of any predictor in that grid cell is\\nachieved), bounding box coordinate errors are penalized.\\nThe YOLO consists of 24 conv layers and 2 FC layers,\\nof which some conv layers construct ensembles of inception\\nmodules with 1 ×1 reduction layers followed by 3 ×3 conv\\nlayers. The network can process images in real-time at 45\\nFPS and a simpliﬁed version Fast YOLO can reach 155 FPS\\nwith better results than other real-time detectors. Furthermore,\\nYOLO produces fewer false positives on background, which\\nmakes the cooperation with Fast R-CNN become possible. An\\nimproved version, YOLOv2, was later proposed in [72], which\\nadopts several impressive strategies, such as BN, anchor boxes,\\ndimension cluster and multi-scale training.\\n3) SSD: YOLO has a difﬁculty in dealing with small\\nobjects in groups, which is caused by strong spatial constraints\\nimposed on bounding box predictions [17]. Meanwhile, YOLO\\nstruggles to generalize to objects in new/unusual aspect ratios/\\nconﬁgurations and produces relatively coarse features due to\\nmultiple downsampling operations.\\nAiming at these problems, Liu et al. proposed a Single Shot\\nMultiBox Detector (SSD) [71], which was inspired by the\\nanchors adopted in MultiBox [68], RPN [18] and multi-scale\\nrepresentation [95]. Given a speciﬁc feature map, instead of\\nﬁxed grids adopted in YOLO, the SSD takes advantage of a set\\nof default anchor boxes with different aspect ratios and scales\\nto discretize the output space of bounding boxes. To handle\\nobjects with various sizes, the network fuses predictions from\\nmultiple feature maps with different resolutions .\\nThe architecture of SSD is demonstrated in Figure 10. Given\\nthe VGG16 backbone architecture, SSD adds several feature\\nlayers to the end of the network, which are responsible for\\npredicting the offsets to default boxes with different scales and\\naspect ratios and their associated conﬁdences. The network is\\ntrained with a weighted sum of localization loss (e.g. Smooth\\nL1) and conﬁdence loss (e.g. Softmax), which is similar to\\n(1). Final detection results are obtained by conducting NMS\\non multi-scale reﬁned bounding boxes.\\nIntegrating with hard negative mining, data augmentation\\nand a larger number of carefully chosen default anchors,\\nSSD signiﬁcantly outperforms the Faster R-CNN in terms of\\naccuracy on PASCAL VOC and COCO, while being three\\ntimes faster. The SSD300 (input image size is 300×300) runs\\nat 59 FPS, which is more accurate and efﬁcient than YOLO.\\nHowever, SSD is not skilled at dealing with small objects,\\nwhich can be relieved by adopting better feature extractor\\nbackbone (e.g. ResNet101), adding deconvolution layers with\\nskip connections to introduce additional large-scale context\\n[73] and designing better network structure (e.g. Stem Block\\nand Dense Block) [74].'),\n",

Experimental Evaluation\\nWe compare various object detection methods on three\\nbenchmark datasets, including PASCAL VOC 2007 [25],\\nPASCAL VOC 2012 [121] and Microsoft COCO [94]. The\\nevaluated approaches include R-CNN [15], SPP-net [64], Fast\\nR-CNN [16], NOC [114], Bayes [85], MR-CNN &S-CNN\\n[105], Faster R-CNN [18], HyperNet [101], ION [95], MS-\\nGR [104], StuffNet [100], SSD300 [71], SSD512 [71], OHEM\\n[113], SDP+CRC [33], GCNN [70], SubCNN [60], GBD-Net\\n[109], PV ANET [116], YOLO [17], YOLOv2 [72], R-FCN\\n[65], FPN [66], Mask R-CNN [67], DSSD [73] and DSOD\\n[74]. If no speciﬁc instructions for the adopted framework\\nare provided, the utilized model is a VGG16 [46] pretrained\\non 1000-way ImageNet classiﬁcation task [39]. Due to the\\nlimitation of paper length, we only provide an overview, in-\\ncluding proposal, learning method, loss function, programming\\nlanguage and platform, of the prominent architectures in Table\\nI. Detailed experimental settings, which can be found in the\\noriginal papers, are missed. In addition to the comparisons of\\ndetection accuracy, another comparison is provided to evaluate\\ntheir test consumption on PASCAL VOC 2007.\\n1) PASCAL VOC 2007/2012: PASCAL VOC 2007 and\\n2012 datasets consist of 20 categories. The evaluation terms\\nare Average Precision (AP) in each single category and mean\\nAverage Precision (mAP) across all the 20 categories. Com-\\nparative results are exhibited in Table II and III, from which\\nthe following remarks can be obtained.\\n•If incorporated with a proper way, more powerful back-\\nbone CNN models can deﬁnitely improve object detection\\nperformance (the comparison among R-CNN with AlexNet,\\nR-CNN with VGG16 and SPP-net with ZF-Net [122]).\\n• With the introduction of SPP layer (SPP-net), end-to-\\nend multi-task architecture (FRCN) and RPN (Faster R-\\nCNN), object detection performance is improved gradually\\nand apparently.\\n•Due to large quantities of trainable parameters, in order to\\nobtain multi-level robust features, data augmentation is very\\nimportant for deep learning based models (Faster R-CNN\\nwith ‘07’ ,‘07+12’ and ‘07+12+coco’).\\n•Apart from basic models, there are still many other factors\\naffecting object detection performance, such as multi-scale\\nand multi-region feature extraction (e.g. MR-CNN), modi-\\nﬁed classiﬁcation networks (e.g. NOC), additional informa-\\ntion from other correlated tasks (e.g. StuffNet, HyperNet),\\nmulti-scale representation (e.g. ION) and mining of hard\\nnegative samples (e.g. OHEM).\\n•As YOLO is not skilled in producing object localizations\\nof high IoU, it obtains a very poor result on VOC 2012.\\nHowever, with the complementary information from Fast\\nR-CNN (YOLO+FRCN) and the aid of other strategies,\\nsuch as anchor boxes, BN and ﬁne grained features, the\\nlocalization errors are corrected (YOLOv2).\\n•By combining many recent tricks and modelling the whole\\nnetwork as a fully convolutional one, R-FCN achieves a\\nmore obvious improvement of detection performance over\\nother approaches.\\n2) Microsoft COCO: Microsoft COCO is composed of\\n300,000 fully segmented images, in which each image has\\nan average of 7 object instances from a total of 80 categories.\\nAs there are a lot of less iconic objects with a broad range\\nof scales and a stricter requirement on object localization,\\nthis dataset is more challenging than PASCAL 2012. Object\\ndetection performance is evaluated by AP computed under\\ndifferent degrees of IoUs and on different object sizes. The\\nresults are shown in Table IV.\\nBesides similar remarks to those of PASCAL VOC, some\\nother conclusions can be drawn as follows from Table IV.\\n• Multi-scale training and test are beneﬁcial in improv-\\ning object detection performance, which provide additional\\ninformation in different resolutions (R-FCN). FPN and\\nDSSD provide some better ways to build feature pyramids\\nto achieve multi-scale representation. The complementary\\ninformation from other related tasks is also helpful for\\naccurate object localization (Mask R-CNN with instance\\nsegmentation task).\\n• Overall, region proposal based methods, such as\\nFaster R-CNN and R-FCN, perform better than regres-\\nsion/classﬁcation based approaches, namely YOLO and\\nSSD, due to the fact that quite a lot of localization errors\\nare produced by regression/classﬁcation based approaches.\\n• Context modelling is helpful to locate small objects,\\nwhich provides additional information by consulting nearby\\nobjects and surroundings (GBD-Net and multi-path).\\n•Due to the existence of a large number of nonstandard\\nsmall objects, the results on this dataset are much worse\\nthan those of VOC 2007/2012. With the introduction of\\nother powerful frameworks (e.g. ResNeXt [123]) and useful\\nstrategies (e.g. multi-task learning [67], [124]), the perfor-\\nmance can be improved.\\n•The success of DSOD in training from scratch stresses the\\nimportance of network design to release the requirements\\nfor perfect pre-trained classiﬁers on relevant tasks and large\\nnumbers of annotated samples.\\n3) Timing Analysis: Timing analysis (Table V) is conducted\\non Intel i7-6700K CPU with a single core and NVIDIA Titan'),\n",

S ALIENT OBJECT DETECTION\\nVisual saliency detection, one of the most important and\\nchallenging tasks in computer vision, aims to highlight the\\nmost dominant object regions in an image. Numerous ap-\\nplications incorporate the visual saliency to improve their\\nperformance, such as image cropping [125] and segmentation\\n[126], image retrieval [57] and object detection [66].\\nBroadly, there are two branches of approaches in salient\\nobject detection, namely bottom-up (BU) [127] and top-down\\n(TD) [128]. Local feature contrast plays the central role in BU\\nsalient object detection, regardless of the semantic contents of\\nthe scene. To learn local feature contrast, various local and\\nglobal features are extracted from pixels, e.g. edges [129],\\nspatial information [130]. However, high-level and multi-scale\\nsemantic information cannot be explored with these low-level\\nfeatures. As a result, low contrast salient maps instead of\\nsalient objects are obtained. TD salient object detection is task-\\noriented and takes prior knowledge about object categories\\nto guide the generation of salient maps. Taking semantic\\nsegmentation as an example, a saliency map is generated in the\\nsegmentation to assign pixels to particular object categories via\\na TD approach [131]. In a word, TD saliency can be viewed\\nas a focus-of-attention mechanism, which prunes BU salient\\npoints that are unlikely to be parts of the object [132].\\nA. Deep learning in Salient Object Detection\\nDue to the signiﬁcance for providing high-level and multi-\\nscale feature representation and the successful applications\\nin many correlated computer vision tasks, such as semantic\\nsegmentation [131], edge detection [133] and generic object\\ndetection [16], it is feasible and necessary to extend CNN to\\nsalient object detection.\\nThe early work by Eleonora Vig et al. [28] follows a\\ncompletely automatic data-driven approach to perform a large-\\nscale search for optimal features, namely an ensemble of deep\\nnetworks with different layers and parameters. To address the\\nproblem of limited training data, Kummerer et al. proposed the\\nDeep Gaze [134] by transferring from the AlexNet to generate\\na high dimensional feature space and create a saliency map. A\\nsimilar architecture was proposed by Huang et al. to integrate\\nsaliency prediction into pre-trained object recognition DNNs\\n[135]. The transfer is accomplished by ﬁne-tuning DNNs’\\nweights with an objective function based on the saliency\\nevaluation metrics, such as Similarity, KL-Divergence and\\nNormalized Scanpath Saliency.\\nSome works combined local and global visual clues to\\nimprove salient object detection performance. Wang et al.\\ntrained two independent deep CNNs (DNN-L and DNN-G)\\nto capture local information and global contrast and predicted\\nsaliency maps by integrating both local estimation and global\\nsearch [136]. Cholakkal et al. proposed a weakly supervised\\nsaliency detection framework to combine visual saliency from\\nbottom-up and top-down saliency maps, and reﬁned the results\\nwith a multi-scale superpixel-averaging [137]. Zhao et al.\\nproposed a multi-context deep learning framework, which\\nutilizes a uniﬁed learning framework to model global and\\nlocal context jointly with the aid of superpixel segmentation\\n[138]. To predict saliency in videos, Bak et al. fused two\\nstatic saliency models, namely spatial stream net and tem-\\nporal stream net, into a two-stream framework with a novel\\nempirically grounded data augmentation technique [139].\\nComplementary information from semantic segmentation\\nand context modeling is beneﬁcial. To learn internal represen-\\ntations of saliency efﬁciently, He et al. proposed a novel su-\\nperpixelwise CNN approach called SuperCNN [140], in which\\nsalient object detection is formulated as a binary labeling\\nproblem. Based on a fully convolutional neural network, Li\\net al. proposed a multi-task deep saliency model, in which\\nintrinsic correlations between saliency detection and semantic\\nsegmentation are set up [141]. However, due to the conv layers\\nwith large receptive ﬁelds and pooling layers, blurry object\\nboundaries and coarse saliency maps are produced. Tang et\\nal. proposed a novel saliency detection framework (CRPSD)\\n[142], which combines region-level saliency estimation and\\npixel-level saliency prediction together with three closely\\nrelated CNNs. Li et al. proposed a deep contrast network\\nto combine segment-wise spatial pooling and pixel-level fully\\nconvolutional streams [143].\\nThe proper integration of multi-scale feature maps is also\\nof signiﬁcance for improving detection performance. Based\\non Fast R-CNN, Wang et al. proposed the RegionNet by\\nperforming salient object detection with end-to-end edge pre-\\nserving and multi-scale contextual modelling [144]. Liu et al.\\n[27] proposed a multi-resolution convolutional neural network\\n(Mr-CNN) to predict eye ﬁxations, which is achieved by\\nlearning both bottom-up visual saliency and top-down visual\\nfactors from raw image data simultaneously. Cornia et al.\\nproposed an architecture which combines features extracted at\\ndifferent levels of the CNN [145]. Li et al. proposed a multi-\\nscale deep CNN framework to extract three scales of deep\\ncontrast features [146], namely the mean-subtracted region,\\nthe bounding box of its immediate neighboring regions and\\nthe masked entire image, from each candidate region.\\nIt is efﬁcient and accurate to train a direct pixel-wise\\nCNN architecture to predict salient objects with the aids of\\nRNNs and deconvolution networks. Pan et al. formulated\\nsaliency prediction as a minimization optimization on the\\nEuclidean distance between the predicted saliency map and\\nthe ground truth and proposed two kinds of architectures\\n[147]: a shallow one trained from scratch and a deeper one\\nadapted from deconvoluted VGG network. As convolutional-\\ndeconvolution networks are not expert in recognizing objects\\nof multiple scales, Kuen et al. proposed a recurrent attentional\\nconvolutional-deconvolution network (RACDNN) with several\\nspatial transformer and recurrent network units to conquer\\nthis problem [148]. To fuse local, global and contextual\\ninformation of salient objects, Tang et al. developed a deeply-\\nsupervised recurrent convolutional neural network (DSRCNN)\\nto perform a full image-to-image saliency detection [149].'),\n",

Experimental Evaluation\\nFour representative datasets, including ECSSD [156], HKU-\\nIS [146], PASCALS [157], and SOD [158], are used to\\nevaluate several state-of-the-art methods. ECSSD consists of\\n1000 structurally complex but semantically meaningful natural\\nimages. HKU-IS is a large-scale dataset containing over 4000\\nchallenging images. Most of these images have more than\\none salient object and own low contrast. PASCALS is a\\nsubset chosen from the validation set of PASCAL VOC 2010\\nsegmentation dataset and is composed of 850 natural images.\\nThe SOD dataset possesses 300 images containing multiple\\nsalient objects. The training and validation sets for different\\ndatasets are kept the same as those in [152].\\nTwo standard metrics, namely F-measure and the mean\\nabsolute error (MAE), are utilized to evaluate the quality of a\\nsaliency map. Given precision and recall values pre-computed\\non the union of generated binary mask B and ground truth Z,\\nF-measure is deﬁned as below\\nFβ = (1 +β2)Presion ×Recall\\nβ2Presion + Recall (7)\\nwhere β2 is set to 0.3 in order to stress the importance of the\\nprecision value.\\nThe MAE score is computed with the following equation\\nMAE = 1\\nH×W\\nH∑\\ni=1\\nW∑\\nj=1\\n⏐⏐⏐ˆS(i,j) = ˆZ(i,j)\\n⏐⏐⏐ (8)\\nwhere ˆZ and ˆS represent the ground truth and the continuous\\nsaliency map, respectively. W and H are the width and\\nheight of the salient area, respectively. This score stresses\\nthe importance of successfully detected salient objects over\\ndetected non-salient pixels [159].\\nThe following approaches are evaluated: CHM [150], RC\\n[151], DRFI [152], MC [138], MDF [146], LEGS [136], DSR\\n[149], MTDNN [141], CRPSD [142], DCL [143], ELD [153],\\nNLDF [154] and DSSC [155]. Among these methods, CHM,\\nRC and DRFI are classical ones with the best performance\\n[159], while the other methods are all associated with CNN.\\nF-measure and MAE scores are shown in Table VI.\\nFrom Table VI, we can ﬁnd that CNN based methods\\nperform better than classic methods. MC and MDF combine\\nthe information from local and global context to reach a\\nmore accurate saliency. ELD refers to low-level handcrafted\\nfeatures for complementary information. LEGS adopts generic\\nregion proposals to provide initial salient regions, which may\\nbe insufﬁcient for salient detection. DSR and MT act in\\ndifferent ways by introducing recurrent network and semantic\\nsegmentation, which provide insights for future improvements.\\nCPRSD, DCL, NLDF and DSSC are all based on multi-scale\\nrepresentations and superpixel segmentation, which provide\\nrobust salient regions and smooth boundaries. DCL, NLDF\\nand DSSC perform the best on these four datasets. DSSC\\nearns the best performance by modelling scale-to-scale short-\\nconnections.\\nOverall, as CNN mainly provides salient information in\\nlocal regions, most of CNN based methods need to model\\nvisual saliency along region boundaries with the aid of su-\\nperpixel segmentation. Meanwhile, the extraction of multi-\\nscale deep CNN features is of signiﬁcance for measuring local\\nconspicuity. Finally, it’s necessary to strengthen local con-\\nnections between different CNN layers and as well to utilize\\ncomplementary information from local and global context.\\nV. F ACE DETECTION\\nFace detection is essential to many face applications and acts\\nas an important pre-processing procedure to face recognition\\n[160]–[162], face synthesis [163], [164] and facial expression\\nanalysis [165]. Different from generic object detection, this\\ntask is to recognize and locate face regions covering a very\\nlarge range of scales (30-300 pts vs. 10-1000 pts). At the same\\ntime, faces have their unique object structural conﬁgurations\\n(e.g. the distribution of different face parts) and characteristics\\n(e.g. skin color). All these differences lead to special attention\\nto this task. However, large visual variations of faces, such as\\nocclusions, pose variations and illumination changes, impose\\ngreat challenges for this task in real applications.\\nThe most famous face detector proposed by Viola and\\nJones [166] trains cascaded classiﬁers with Haar-Like features\\nand AdaBoost, achieving good performance with real-time\\nefﬁciency. However, this detector may degrade signiﬁcantly\\nin real-world applications due to larger visual variations of\\nhuman faces. Different from this cascade structure, Felzen-\\nszwalb et al. proposed a deformable part model (DPM) for face\\ndetection [24]. However, for these traditional face detection\\nmethods, high computational expenses and large quantities\\nof annotations are required to achieve a reasonable result.\\nBesides, their performance is greatly restricted by manually\\ndesigned features and shallow architecture.\\nA. Deep learning in Face Detection\\nRecently, some CNN based face detection approaches have\\nbeen proposed [167]–[169].As less accurate localization re-\\nsults from independent regressions of object coordinates, Yu\\net al. [167] proposed a novel IoU loss function for predicting\\nthe four bounds of box jointly. Farfade et al. [168] proposed a\\nDeep Dense Face Detector (DDFD) to conduct multi-view face\\ndetection, which is able to detect faces in a wide range of ori-\\nentations without requirement of pose/landmark annotations.\\nYang et al. proposed a novel deep learning based face detection\\nframework [169], which collects the responses from local fa-\\ncial parts (e.g. eyes, nose and mouths) to address face detection\\nunder severe occlusions and unconstrained pose variations.\\nYang et al. [170] proposed a scale-friendly detection network\\nnamed ScaleFace, which splits a large range of target scales\\ninto smaller sub-ranges. Different specialized sub-networks are\\nconstructed on these sub-scales and combined into a single\\none to conduct end-to-end optimization. Hao et al. designed an\\nefﬁcient CNN to predict the scale distribution histogram of the\\nfaces and took this histogram to guide the zoom-in and zoom-\\nout of the image [171]. Since the faces are approximately\\nin uniform scale after zoom, compared with other state-of-\\nthe-art baselines, better performance is achieved with less\\ncomputation cost. Besides, some generic detection frameworks'),\n",

P EDESTRIAN DETECTION\\nRecently, pedestrian detection has been intensively studied,\\nwhich has a close relationship to pedestrian tracking [189],\\n[190], person re-identiﬁcation [191], [192] and robot naviga-\\ntion [193], [194]. Prior to the recent progress in DCNN based\\nmethods [195], [196], some researchers combined boosted\\ndecision forests with hand-crafted features to obtain pedestrian\\ndetectors [197]–[199]. At the same time, to explicitly model\\nthe deformation and occlusion, part-based models [200] and\\nexplicit occlusion handling [201], [202] are of concern.\\nAs there are many pedestrian instances of small sizes\\nin typical scenarios of pedestrian detection (e.g. automatic\\ndriving and intelligent surveillance), the application of RoI\\npooling layer in generic object detection pipeline may result\\nin ‘plain’ features due to collapsing bins. In the meantime, the\\nmain source of false predictions in pedestrian detection is the\\nconfusion of hard background instances, which is in contrast\\nto the interference from multiple categories in generic object\\ndetection. As a result, different conﬁgurations and components\\nare required to accomplish accurate pedestrian detection.\\nA. Deep learning in Pedestrian Detection\\nAlthough DCNNs have obtained excellent performance on\\ngeneric object detection [16], [72], none of these approaches\\nhave achieved better results than the best hand-crafted feature\\nbased method [198] for a long time, even when part-based\\ninformation and occlusion handling are incorporated [202].\\nThereby, some researches have been conducted to analyze the\\nreasons. Zhang et al. attempted to adapt generic Faster R-CNN\\n[18] to pedestrian detection [203]. They modiﬁed the down-\\nstream classiﬁer by adding boosted forests to shared, high-\\nresolution conv feature maps and taking a RPN to handle small\\ninstances and hard negative examples. To deal with complex\\nocclusions existing in pedestrian images, inspired by DPM\\n[24], Tian et al. proposed a deep learning framework called\\nDeepParts [204], which makes decisions based an ensemble of\\nextensive part detectors. DeepParts has advantages in dealing\\nwith weakly labeled data, low IoU positive proposals and\\npartial occlusion.\\nOther researchers also tried to combine complementary in-\\nformation from multiple data sources. CompACT-Deep adopts\\na complexity-aware cascade to combine hand-crafted features\\nand ﬁne-tuned DCNNs [195]. Based on Faster R-CNN, Liu et\\nal. proposed multi-spectral deep neural networks for pedestrian\\ndetection to combine complementary information from color\\nand thermal images [205]. Tian et al. [206] proposed a task-\\nassistant CNN (TA-CNN) to jointly learn multiple tasks with\\nTABLE VII\\nDETAILED BREAKDOWN PERFORMANCE COMPARISONS OF\\nSTATE-OF-THE -ART MODELS ON CALTECH PEDESTRIAN DATASET .

Hu et al. [208] trained an ensemble of\\nboosted decision models by reusing the conv feature maps, and\\na further improvement was gained with simple pixel labelling\\nand additional complementary hand-crafted features.

The ﬁrst two methods are based\\non hand-crafted features while the rest ones rely on deep CNN\\nfeatures. All results are exhibited in Table VII. From this table,\\nwe observe that different from other tasks, classic handcrafted\\nfeatures can still earn competitive results with boosted decision\\nforests [203], ACF [197] and HOG+LUV channels [S2]. As\\nan early attempt to adapt CNN to pedestrian detection, the\\nfeatures generated by SCF+AlexNet are not so discriminant\\nand produce relatively poor results. Based on multiple CNNs,\\nDeepParts and CompACT-Deep accomplish detection tasks via\\ndifferent strategies, namely local part integration and cascade\\nnetwork. The responses from different local part detectors\\nmake DeepParts robust to partial occlusions. However, due to\\ncomplexity, it is too time-consuming to achieve real-time de-\\ntection. The multi-scale representation of MS-CNN improves\\naccuracy of pedestrian locations. SA-FastRCNN extends Fast\\nR-CNN to automatically detecting pedestrians according to\\ntheir different scales, which has trouble when there are partial\\nocclusions. RPN+BF combines the detectors produced by\\nFaster R-CNN with boosting decision forest to accurately\\nlocate different pedestrians. F-DNN+SS, which is composed\\nof multiple parallel classiﬁers with soft rejections, performs\\nthe best followed by RPN+BF, SA-FastRCNN and MS-CNN.\\nIn short, CNN based methods can provide more accurate\\ncandidate boxes and multi-level semantic information for\\nidentifying and locating pedestrians. Meanwhile, handcrafted\\nfeatures are complementary and can be combined with CNN\\nto achieve better results. The improvements over existing CNN\\nmethods can be obtained by carefully designing the framework\\nand classiﬁers, extracting multi-scale and part based semantic\\ninformation and searching for complementary information\\nfrom other related tasks, such as segmentation.\\nVII. P ROMISING FUTURE DIRECTIONS AND TASKS\\nIn spite of rapid development and achieved promising\\nprogress of object detection, there are still many open issues\\nfor future work.\\nThe ﬁrst one is small object detection such as occurring\\nin COCO dataset and in face detection task. To improve\\nlocalization accuracy on small objects under partial occlusions,\\nit is necessary to modify network architectures from the\\nfollowing aspects.\\n• Multi-task joint optimization and multi-modal infor-\\nmation fusion. Due to the correlations between different\\ntasks within and outside object detection, multi-task joint\\noptimization has already been studied by many researchers\\n[16] [18]. However, apart from the tasks mentioned in\\nSubs. III-A8, it is desirable to think over the characteristics\\nof different sub-tasks of object detection (e.g. superpixel\\nsemantic segmentation in salient object detection) and ex-\\ntend multi-task optimization to other applications such as\\ninstance segmentation [66], multi-object tracking [202] and\\nmulti-person pose estimation [S4]. Besides, given a speciﬁc\\napplication, the information from different modalities, such\\nas text [212], thermal data [205] and images [65], can be\\nfused together to achieve a more discriminant network.\\n•Scale adaption. Objects usually exist in different scales,\\nwhich is more apparent in face detection and pedestrian\\ndetection. To increase the robustness to scale changes, it\\nis demanded to train scale-invariant, multi-scale or scale-\\nadaptive detectors. For scale-invariant detectors, more pow-\\nerful backbone architectures (e.g. ResNext [123]), negative\\nsample mining [113], reverse connection [213] and sub-\\ncategory modelling [60] are all beneﬁcial. For multi-scale\\ndetectors, both the FPN [66] which produces multi-scale\\nfeature maps and Generative Adversarial Network [214]\\nwhich narrows representation differences between small ob-\\njects and the large ones with a low-cost architecture provide\\ninsights into generating meaningful feature pyramid. For\\nscale-adaptive detectors, it is useful to combine knowledge\\ngraph [215], attentional mechanism [216], cascade network\\n[180] and scale distribution estimation [171] to detect ob-\\njects adaptively.\\n•Spatial correlations and contextual modelling. Spatial\\ndistribution plays an important role in object detection. So\\nregion proposal generation and grid regression are taken\\nto obtain probable object locations. However, the corre-\\nlations between multiple proposals and object categories\\nare ignored. Besides, the global structure information is\\nabandoned by the position-sensitive score maps in R-FCN.\\nTo solve these problems, we can refer to diverse subset\\nselection [217] and sequential reasoning tasks [218] for\\npossible solutions. It is also meaningful to mask salient parts\\nand couple them with the global structure in a joint-learning\\nmanner [219].\\nThe second one is to release the burden on manual labor and\\naccomplish real-time object detection, with the emergence of\\nlarge-scale image and video data. The following three aspects\\ncan be taken into account.\\n•Cascade network. In a cascade network, a cascade of\\ndetectors are built in different stages or layers [180], [220].\\nAnd easily distinguishable examples are rejected at shallow\\nlayers so that features and classiﬁers at latter stages can\\nhandle more difﬁcult samples with the aid of the decisions\\nfrom previous stages. However, current cascades are built in\\na greedy manner, where previous stages in cascade are ﬁxed\\nwhen training a new stage. So the optimizations of different\\nCNNs are isolated, which stresses the necessity of end-to-\\nend optimization for CNN cascade. At the same time, it\\nis also a matter of concern to build contextual associated\\ncascade networks with existing layers.\\n• Unsupervised and weakly supervised learning. It’s\\nvery time consuming to manually draw large quantities\\nof bounding boxes. To release this burden, semantic prior\\n[55], unsupervised object discovery [221], multiple instance\\nlearning [222] and deep neural network prediction [47] can\\nbe integrated to make best use of image-level supervision to\\nassign object category tags to corresponding object regions\\nand reﬁne object boundaries. Furthermore, weakly annota-\\ntions (e.g. center-click annotations [223]) are also helpful\\nfor achieving high-quality detectors with modest annotation\\nefforts, especially aided by the mobile platform.\\n• Network optimization. Given speciﬁc applications and\\nplatforms, it is signiﬁcant to make a balance among speed,'),\n",

However, despite that detection\\naccuracy is reduced, it is more meaningful to learn compact\\nmodels with fewer number of parameters [209]. And this\\nsituation can be relieved by introducing better pre-training\\nschemes [225], knowledge distillation [226] and hint learn-\\ning [227]. DSOD also provides a promising guideline to\\ntrain from scratch to bridge the gap between different image\\nsources and tasks [74].\\nThe third one is to extend typical methods for 2D object de-\\ntection to adapt 3D object detection and video object detection,\\nwith the requirements from autonomous driving, intelligent\\ntransportation and intelligent surveillance.\\n•3D object detection. With the applications of 3D sensors\\n(e.g. LIDAR and camera), additional depth information can\\nbe utilized to better understand the images in 2D and extend\\nthe image-level knowledge to the real world. However,\\nseldom of these 3D-aware techniques aim to place correct\\n3D bounding boxes around detected objects. To achieve\\nbetter bounding results, multi-view representation [181] and\\n3D proposal network [228] may provide some guidelines to\\nencode depth information with the aid of inertial sensors\\n(accelerometer and gyrometer) [229].\\n• Video object detection. Temporal information across\\ndifferent frames play an important role in understanding\\nthe behaviors of different objects. However, the accuracy\\nsuffers from degenerated object appearances (e.g., motion\\nblur and video defocus) in videos and the network is\\nusually not trained end-to-end. To this end, spatiotemporal\\ntubelets [230], optical ﬂow [199] and LSTM [107] should\\nbe considered to fundamentally model object associations\\nbetween consecutive frames.\\nVIII. C ONCLUSION\\nDue to its powerful learning ability and advantages in\\ndealing with occlusion, scale transformation and background\\nswitches, deep learning based object detection has been a\\nresearch hotspot in recent years. This paper provides a detailed\\nreview on deep learning based object detection frameworks\\nwhich handle different sub-problems, such as occlusion, clutter\\nand low resolution, with different degrees of modiﬁcations\\non R-CNN. The review starts on generic object detection\\npipelines which provide base architectures for other related\\ntasks. Then, three other common tasks, namely salient object\\ndetection, face detection and pedestrian detection, are also\\nbrieﬂy reviewed. Finally, we propose several promising future\\ndirections to gain a thorough understanding of the object\\ndetection landscape. This review is also meaningful for the\\ndevelopments in neural networks and related learning systems,\\nwhich provides valuable insights and guidelines for future\\nprogress.\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\nThis research was supported by the National Natural Sci-\\nence Foundation of China (No.61672203 & 61375047 &\\n91746209), the National Key Research and Development Pro-\\ngram of China (2016YFB1000901), and Anhui Natural Sci-\\nence Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar (No.170808J08).\\nREFERENCES\\n[1] P.

Hangal, one of Hindi cinema’s most famous\\ncharacter actors. For his age, he is rather energetic. “What’s the secret?”\\nwe ask. “My intake of everything is in small quantities. And I walk a lot,”\\nhe replies. “I joined the industry when people retire. I was in my 40s. So\\nI don’t miss being called a star . I am still r espected and given work,\\nwhen actors of my age are living in poverty and without work. I don’t\\nhave any complaints,” he says, adding, “but yes, I have always been\\nunderpaid.” Recipient of the Padma Bhushan, Hangal never hankered\\nafter money or materialistic gains. “No doubt I am content today, but\\nmoney is important. I was a fool not to understand the value of money\\nearlier,” he r egrets.\\n1. Anger Management: As adults, one important thing to learn is how to manage\\nour temper.

But suppose they do not?”\\n“Nonsense! How dare they be so insolent? Are you not…”\\n“I am very busy this afternoon and cannot stop to argue it out. But I\\nmust refuse to tyrannise.”\\n“It would not be tyranny for selfish gain, but for the sake of the\\ncountry.”\\n“To tyrannise for the country is to tyrannise over the country. But\\nthat I am afraid you will never understand.” With this I came away.\\n3.

Due to the correlations between different\\ntasks within and outside object detection, multi-task joint\\noptimization has already been studied by many researchers\\n[16] [18]. However, apart from the tasks mentioned in\\nSubs. III-A8, it is desirable to think over the characteristics\\nof different sub-tasks of object detection (e.g. superpixel\\nsemantic segmentation in salient object detection) and ex-\\ntend multi-task optimization to other applications such as\\ninstance segmentation [66], multi-object tracking [202] and\\nmulti-person pose estimation [S4].

To increase the robustness to scale changes, it\\nis demanded to train scale-invariant, multi-scale or scale-\\nadaptive detectors. For scale-invariant detectors, more pow-\\nerful backbone architectures (e.g. ResNext [123]), negative\\nsample mining [113], reverse connection [213] and sub-\\ncategory modelling [60] are all beneﬁcial. For multi-scale\\ndetectors, both the FPN [66] which produces multi-scale\\nfeature maps and Generative Adversarial Network [214]\\nwhich narrows representation differences between small ob-\\njects and the large ones with a low-cost architecture provide\\ninsights into generating meaningful feature pyramid.

Local feature contrast plays the central role in BU\\nsalient object detection, regardless of the semantic contents of\\nthe scene. To learn local feature contrast, various local and\\nglobal features are extracted from pixels, e.g. edges [129],\\nspatial information [130]. However, high-level and multi-scale\\nsemantic information cannot be explored with these low-level\\nfeatures. As a result, low contrast salient maps instead of\\nsalient objects are obtained.
